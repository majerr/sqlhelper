## Introduction 

`sqlhelper` maintains a cache of database connections internally. The package
initially attempts to populate the cache during loading but the cache is mutable
(so may be altered subsequently). This article describes the processes by which
`sqlhelper` populates the connections cache and the options for adjusting it
after loading.

The basic steps in the process are:

#. Search for YAML config files
#. Read and validate config files
#. Combine connection definitions from separate config files into a single ordered list of unique definitions
#. Set one connection definition as the default
#.
