is.connected and not.connected provide generic, semantically transparent
methods of checking whether a connection is live, irrespective of whether it
is through RODBC, RPostgreSQL, DBI etc. They depend on the is.live functions
provided by getrunparams (see above).

not.connected returns TRUE if the db connection returned by getrunparams is
not valid
